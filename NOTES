This works with 5.0.75.  I haven't tried with 4.x nor 5.1.  I suspect
the former won't work, but the latter probably will.

N.B. that all the paths are hard-coded and assume MacPorts-ish
locations.

Things to do:

  * Complete coverage for SqlValue types in parameter binding.  I
    don't think MySQL has anything that maps onto the SqlTimeDiff
    type.

  * Double-check coverage for result bindings.

  * Throw exceptions instead of "error".  Where is throwDyn?

  * Fill in various other missing holes (notably, table and statement
    description).

  * Verify that FFI's "with*" functions create a pinned pointer.

  * All the parameters that you need to create a connection is a bit
    nasty.  I could go parse a JDBC-like string, but, ...

There's a little test program that runs a query and spews out the
results.  To compile it,

  ghc -idist/build -L/opt/local/lib/mysql5/mysql -lmysqlclient --make Test
