	* HDBC-mysql-0.6. Use Foreign.Concurrent to correctly incorporate
	Haskell finalizer for binds.  Fix handling of SqlWord32 and
	SqlWord64 values: tip o' the cap to yeoh@cs.wisc.edu.

	* HDBC-mysql-0.5. Use "throwSqlError" instead of "throwDyn" so
	that we get legible errors under ghc-6.10.  This also removes the
	dependency on base 3.

	* HDBC-mysql-0.4. Fix incorrect binding size (should always be 4
	bytes, not compiler's "long") for MYSQL_TYPE_LONG columns.

	* HDBC-mysql-0.3 Deal with some of the problems where statements
	would mysteriously "close".  It turns out that only one statement
	can be "active" on a connection at a time, and that closing an
	inactive statement causes the current statement to close as well.

	* HDBC-mysql-0.2 Fix binding width for dates: MySQL's length
	indicates 19 characters (which is the length of the string), but
	we need the full size of the MYSQL_TIME struct.  Leak connections
	and statements until I can figure out how to keep the ForeignPtr's
	alive.
